A PyTorch based 3D Finite Element Solver. It has the following features:
  1. Uses GMSH for mesh generation.
  2. Uses PyTorch libraries matrix manipulations.
  3. Produces output which can be visulaized using ParaView.
  4. Uses scipy for sparse matrix operations.
  5. No loop over gauss integration points.
 Run main.py for starting running the FEA code.
